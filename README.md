### Love2D packaging script for Windows x64/x86

This script generates zip files containing your packaged game for 32 and 64 bit Windows.
Currently the script only works with Love2D 0.10.2 which comes included.

## Usage

#### Make sure to make script executable

```
chmod +x build.sh
```

#### Run the script

```
./build.sh <path_to_love_file>
```

#### Enjoy

Archives get put into a build folder.

## TODO

- Add Linux support (Maybe even MacOS)
- Allow for different versions of Love2D
